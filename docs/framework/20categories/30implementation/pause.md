### Ability to Pause Project
Smart contracts have functions that execute parts of the project. 
For example, a function could mint coins based on actions on 
another blockchain. The ability to “pause” a function in a 
project allows administrators to stop functions from successfully 
executing. If there is a vulnerability that is being actively 
exploited in a project, having the ability to pause a function 
could stop the exploitation of the project mid way through the 
attack.

When analyzing whether a project can be paused, it is important 
to check whether all data processing functions can be paused, or 
just some parts of the project. The more of data processing 
functions that can be paused, the less risky the project is.
