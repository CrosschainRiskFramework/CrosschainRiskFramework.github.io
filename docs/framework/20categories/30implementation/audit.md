### Code Auditing

Code audits are necessary to ensure that a protocol’s code performs as per its intended logic. Code that has not been audited is far more likely to contain bugs than code that has been audited. Any protocol that does not have code audits should be trusted less by users and developers. However, code audits should not be viewed as a comprehensive security solution.  For example, protocols sometimes conduct audits on specific parts of their architecture or deploy unaudited code for changes/new features, which can be a potential source of risk outside of the initial audit.

Thus, when assessing the security of a protocol based on code audits, one must consider the following:
* Has the code been audited? How many audits have been completed?
* When was the most recent audit? Has the protocol been upgraded since the last audit?
* Is the code for the deployed version of the protocol audited?
* How often is the protocol’s code audited?

While code audits are vital to ensure the robustness of a protocol, they do not guarantee security. In the past, protocols have been compromised despite completing several audits. Thus, audits should only be one of the risk management strategies used by protocols, but not their entire security stack against hacks.
