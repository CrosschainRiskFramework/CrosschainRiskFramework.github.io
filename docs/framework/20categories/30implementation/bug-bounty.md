### Bug Bounty

A public bug bounty program incentivizes [whitehats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)) to uncover and safely disclose vulnerabilities that might exist in a protocol. This increases the number of people that can thoroughly scrutinize a codebase and prevent exploits by malicious actors. Bug bounties have to offer adequate compensation and have clear scope covering the protocol's critical elements. The process requires trust and transparency and should ideally be managed by an independent third party (e.g., [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/)).
