### Well Known Smart Contract Programming Language
More people are likely to be able to review and understand code 
that has been created in programming languages that they are 
familiar with. Solidity is the smart contract programming 
language known by most blockchain developers. Hence, projects 
that use Solidity are inherently less risky than projects that 
use other smart contract programming languages.

Solidity Assembler can be used to implement complex features not 
available in standard Solidity. Assembler code is more complex 
than Solidity code and is more likely to contain bugs and have 
unexpected consequences.
