# Protocol Implementation Risk

Building crosschain protocols involves creating complex on-chain and off-chain components while accounting for the peculiarities and pitfalls of different programming languages, frameworks, virtual machines, and runtime environments. Inevitably, such complexity increases the likelihood of bugs and vulnerabilities. This type of risk has thus far been the most common cause of bridge hacks witnessed over the last couple of years. This section discusses some salient design and implementation considerations and risks.
