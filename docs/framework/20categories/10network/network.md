## Network Consensus Risk

Cross-chain protocols enable the coordination of state changes across networks. This typically requires sending state information from a source network to one or more destination networks and performing consequent state changes. An fundamental assumption in this process is that states in the source network are valid and final according to its consensus rules. There are two considerations concerning this assumption: 1) ensuring the finality of transactions and 2) safety violation in underlying networks.

#### Transaction Finality
Finality models vary significantly across networks. They could be _probabilistic_ or _deterministic_, _instant_ or _eventual_. Networks with _deterministic_ finality offer absolute assurance about the state of a network after some time. In contrast, probabilistic models offer only degrees of confidence, with more crypto-economic assurance achieved over time. For _deterministic_ models, finality could be instantly achieved after a single block or eventually after several blocks. Networks with slower finality times increase latency in cross-chain communication, which impacts the customer experience. However, cross-chain protocols must ensure that the finality of a given state is achieved before relaying the state across chains. Cross-chain protocols, which optimize for performance and relay information across chains without sufficiently waiting for finality, risk creating inconsistencies across networks and the possible loss of user funds.

#### Network Consensus Failure
A more fundamental and systematic problem for cross-chain protocols across sovereign networks is if the ledger of the underlying network undergoes significant reorganizations and reversions. This could result from active network attacks (e.g. 51% attack), hard forks, or bugs in protocol implementations. The likelihood of such failures is higher in chains with fewer validators, lower economic security, or new consensus protocols. Such risks are often beyond the control boundary of cross-chain infrastructure and affect all cross-chain protocols connected to a network simultaneously.

For cross-chain protocols spanning independent networks, this likely represents a [fundamental security limitation](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/) to the security guarantees that such protocols can offer. However, cross-chain protocols can reduce the impact of such failure by limiting contagion to other chains. If a consensus failure in one network can cascade to affect all other chains, then the security of a bridge is dependent on its weakest link.
