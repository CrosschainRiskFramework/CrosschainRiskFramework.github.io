## Network Consensus Risk

Cross-chain protocols primarily enable the coordination of state change across networks. This often requires communicating state in one network over and performing a consequent state transition. A key security assumptions in this process, is that the state communicated from any network is valid and final according to the consensus rules of the underlying network. Failures in this assumption can thus risk creating inconsistent state changes across chains that cannot be reconciled.

There are different ways in which the above assumption could be violated. The first and easiest to mitigate is if protocols do not ensure finality of transactions in a source network before communicating it to a destination network. Finality models across networks might vary significantly, they could be _probabilistic_ or _deterministic_ and _instant_ or _eventual_. Networks with _deterministic_ finality offer clear certainty about the state of a network after some time, whereas probabilistic models offer only degrees of assurance, with more economic assurances achieved over time. For _deterministic_ models, finality could also be _instant_, achieved in a single block or _eventual_, achieved after several blocks or other network conditions. The longer it takes for finality to be achieved, the longer cross-chain communication protocols need to wait before relaying messages from the network. This increases protocol latency and impacts customer experience. Thus, protocols might choose to relay state before strong guarantees of finality are achieved. This creates risk that state in the source network could be reversed, creating inconsistencies across chains, and possible loss of user funds.

A more fundamental and systematic problem for cross-chain protocols spanning independent chains, that will violate the assumptions laid out above is if significant reversions or reorganisation of the ledger occurs in the underlying network. This could be result of a number of reasons including active network attacks (e.g. 51% attack), or bugs in protocol implementations. The likelihood of such failures is higher in smaller chains with fewer validators, lower economic security and new consensus protocols. Such risks are often beyond the control boundary of cross-chain infrastructure and likely represent a fundamental security limitation to bridging across independent sovereign chains. The impact of a failure of this type would simultaneously affect all bridges exposed to the underlying faulty network. However, risk controls can be enacted to limit the magnitude of such failures (e.g. containing and isolating the impact of failures in any single network).
