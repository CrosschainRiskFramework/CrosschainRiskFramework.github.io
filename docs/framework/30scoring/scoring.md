# Risk Scores

This section provides a model for developing a risk score for a project based on the answer to many questions. The score is a combination of the [network consensus](../20categories/10network/network.md#network-consensus-risk), [architectural](../20categories/20architecture/architecture.md#protocol-architecture-risk), [implementation](../20categories/30implementation/protocol-implementation-risk.md#protocol-implementation-risk), and [operational](../20categories/40operation/protocol-operation-risk.md#protocol-operation-risk) risks. A protocol that scores well in all categories will have a high overall score. However, a protocol that scores well in three of the four categories, but scores very poorly in one, will have a low overall score. This reflects how risks materialize in Web3 projects: small single point issues can cause great projects to suffer catastrophic failures. 

How the risk score questions below are answered is subjective. Whereas one person may interpret that a project has complied with a certain consideration, and hence should answer, "yes" to a question, someone else may feel that the project partially complies, and hence the answer should be "no".

A project will receive different scores depending on the information available to the person reviewing the project. As such, it might be expected that a project team that has all the information about a project available to them may be able to score a project accurately. However, a user or external reviewer may not have all of the information available, and may have to make some assumptions. The internal project team may not have adequate perspective or experience to review their own project, hence, even a project team may not be able to provide a completely accurate score. 

A project is likely to receive different scores over time. Based on this risk framework, the project team may take steps to improve their score. Issues that have been undetected could surface and reduce the project's score. Additionally, a project team might issue an upgrade of their protocol. This could invalidate the projects previous risk score. 

Determining the trustworthiness of one crosschain protocol relative to other protocols is an extremely complex task. This risk score model below is just a very preliminary step. Please provide feedback to help us improve this scoring system.
