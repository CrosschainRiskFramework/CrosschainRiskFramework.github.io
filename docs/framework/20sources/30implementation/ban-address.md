### Ability to Ban Addresses
Addresses may be associated with stolen funds. Tornado Cash was 
a project that had sanctions placed against it due to its 
association with stolen funds. Projects that have the 
ability to block these addresses, or freeze in-transit funds 
are more likely to avoid this type of regulatory risk.
