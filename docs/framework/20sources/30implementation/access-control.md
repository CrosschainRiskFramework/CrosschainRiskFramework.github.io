### Role Based Access Control
Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows separate accounts to be 
responsible for different actions. It allows sensitive operations 
to be controlled by one multisig while other less sensitive 
operations can be controlled by a different multisig. 

TODO: Provide example.
