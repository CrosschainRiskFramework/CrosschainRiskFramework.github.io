### Well Known Platform
More people are likely to be able to review and understand projects 
that are created in environments that they are familiar with. The 
majority of the blockchain developers in the world understand 
Ethereum and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Hence, projects 
that use blockchains that support the EVM, or that are forks or 
Ethereum, are inherently less risky than projects that involve 
other blockchains.
