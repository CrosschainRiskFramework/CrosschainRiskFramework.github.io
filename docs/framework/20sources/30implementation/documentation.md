### Documentation
More documentation makes a project easier to analyze. A lack 
of documentation can lead to confusion and issues being 
missed. Projects that have good documentation are easier 
to maintain.

Types of documentation a good project should have are:

* Architecture document that includes the component and deployment architecture.
* Thread model that includes all parts of the project.
* Sequence diagrams for all major data flows.
* Test plan describing how the project will be tested.
* Smart contract code comments at the contract and function level.
* Off-chain code with comments at the class and method level.
* Test code with at least a class level comment.
