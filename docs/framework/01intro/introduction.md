# Introduction

Risk is the measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by potential circumstances or events, and is typically a function of (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs, and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence.  [NIST - National Institute of Standards and Technology]

This document provides a high-level systematic overview of the security risks in cross-chain protocols by identifying, classifying, and analyzing the elements of risk inherent in the design, implementation and operation of such infrastructure. In addition, it profers a set of risk-controls and best practices to mitigate the likelihood and magnitude of various risks. While this document offers a general toolkit for reasoning about cross-chain protocols, it does not directly analyse individual protocols.
