## How to Contribute

Development is done on GitHub in the [https://github.com/CrosschainRiskFramework/CrosschainRiskFramework.github.io](https://github.com/CrosschainRiskFramework/CrosschainRiskFramework.github.io) repository.

To add content, request new features or report issues, please open an issue on GitHub.

To submit a patch, please open a pull request on GitHub. If you 
are thinking of making a large contribution, open an issue for 
it before starting work, to get comments from the community. 
Someone may be already working on the same thing, or there 
may be reasons why that feature isn't implemented.

To make it easier to review and accept your pull request, please 
follow these guidelines:

* Anything other than a trivial contribution requires a [Contributor 
  License Agreement (CLA)](cla.txt), giving us permission to use your code. If 
  your contribution is too small to require a CLA (e.g. fixing a 
  spelling mistake), place the text "CLA: trivial" on a line by itself 
  separated by an empty line from the rest of the commit message. It is 
  not sufficient to only place the text in the GitHub pull request 
  description.

* To amend a missing "CLA: trivial" line after submission, do the following:

    git commit --amend
    [add the line, save and quit the editor]
    git push -f

* Patches should be as current as possible; expect to have to rebase often. We 
  do not accept merge commits, you will have to remove them (usually by 
  rebasing) before it will be acceptable.

* Clean builds via GitHub Actions are required, and they are started automatically whenever a PR is created or updated.
