## Code of Conduct
The Crosschain Risk Framework community consists of its online presence 
in this website and associated GitHub repository. These outlets are managed 
by the Crosschain Risk Framework Management Committee, whose members are 
listed in the Management Committee section of this site.

We strive to be an open and inclusive community where anyone can contribute. 
Contributions should be judged on their own merits; we donâ€™t care about your 
gender identity, race, political beliefs, age, or similar attributes.

If we see that one or more members of the community are generally abusive, 
harassing others, or seem to be trying to intimidate them into leaving 
the community, we will first ask those who are doing so to take a break 
from participation for a while. If you see any evidence of such activity, 
please let us know by contacting the Management Committee via Telegram.
